                <b></b><p><b>Yellowstone National Park Act, 1872</b> - The Act
                    signed into law on March 1, 1872, established the world's first true
                    national park. It withdrew more than two million acres of the public
                    domain in the Montana and Wyoming territories from settlement,
                    occupancy, or sale to be "dedicated and set apart as a public park
                    or pleasuring-ground for the benefit and enjoyment of the people."
                    It placed the park under the control of the Secretary of the
                    Interior and gave the Secretary responsibility for preserving all
                    timber, mineral deposits, geologic wonders, and other resources
                    within the park. The establishment of the park set a precedent for
                    placing other natural reserves under federal jurisdiction.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>Antiquities Act of 1906</b> - The Antiquities Act, signed by
                President Theodore Roosevelt on June 8, 1906, grew out of a movement
                to protect the prehistoric cliff dwellings, pueblo ruins and early
                missions in the Southwest. It authorized Presidents to proclaim and
                reserve "historic landmarks, historic and prehistoric structures,
                and other objects of historic or scientific interest" on lands owned
                or controlled by the United States as "national monuments." It also
                prohibited the excavation or appropriation of antiquities on federal
                lands without permission from the department having jurisdiction.
                Nearly a quarter of the units currently in the National Park System
                originated in whole or part from the Antiquities Act.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>Act to Establish the National Park Service, 1916 (Organic
                Act)</b> - By August 1916 the Department of Interior oversaw 14
                national parks, 21 national monuments, and the Hot Springs and Casa
                Grande Ruin reservations, but there was no unified leadership or
                organization to operate them. Lacking this, the parks and monuments
                were vulnerable to competing interests. With encouragement from
                future directors Stephen T. Mather and Horace Albright, the National
                Geographic Society, journalists, railroad interests and others,
                Congress passed what is often known as the Organic Act, which
                established the National Park Service and placed all the existing
                parks under its management. The legislation established the basis
                for the fundamental mission, philosophy, and policies of the
                National Park Service.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>Reorganization of 1933 </b>- A major reorganization within
                President Franklin Roosevelt's executive branch in 1933 had a
                tremendous impact on the National Park Service. Specifically, two
                executive orders, effective August 10, 1933, transferred the War
                Department's parks and monuments to the National Park Service. In
                addition the National Park Service received all the national
                monuments held by the Forest Service and the responsibility for
                virtually all monuments created thereafter. It also assumed
                responsibility for the parks in the nation's capital, which had
                previously been managed by a separate office in Washington. The
                reorganization was one of the most significant events in the
                evolution of the National Park System. The Service's holdings were
                greatly expanded and there was now a single, national system of
                parklands. With the 1933 reorganization and new responsibilities for
                historical areas, historic preservation became a primary mission of
                the National Park Service. </p><b>
            </b><p><b>Preservation of Historic Sites Act, 1935</b> - The Historic Sites
                Act grew out of the National Park Service's desire for a stronger
                legal underpinning for its expanding historical programs and from
                recognition outside the Service of the need for greater federal
                assistance to historic properties. The Act declared "a national
                policy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings and
                objects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of
                the people of the United States." It assigned broad powers and
                duties to the Secretary of the Interior and the Service, to include
                conducting surveys of historic properties to determine which possess
                exceptional value as commemorating or illustrating U.S. history.
                They were authorized to conduct research; to restore, preserve, and
                maintain historic properties directly or through cooperative
                agreements with other parties; and to mark properties, establish and
                maintain related museums, and engage in other interpretive
                activities for public education. The legislation's provision for a
                historic site survey proved valuable in identifying potential
                additions to the National Park System.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>Wilderness Act of 1964</b> - In the Wilderness Act of 1964,
                Congress adopted a policy of securing wilderness areas for the
                benefit of present and future generations of Americans. It
                established a National Wilderness Preservation System, to be
                composed of federally owned areas designated by Congress as
                "wilderness areas," that would be administered in a way that would
                leave them unimpaired for the use and enjoyment of the American
                people as wilderness areas. The legislation prompted the Service to
                carefully examine all park land that potentially qualified as
                wilderness areas and provided additional legal protection for park
                areas threatened with development. </p><b>
            </b><p><b>Land and Water Conservation Fund Act of 1965</b> - The Land and
                Water Conservation Fund Act established a fund for acquiring new
                recreation lands either within or adjacent to existing park units or
                new parks. Money for the fund would come from surplus property
                sales, motorboat fuel taxes, and other sources. A portion of the
                money in the fund would come from fees charged at existing parks.
                The fund was administered by the Bureau of Outdoor Recreation, a new
                Interior bureau established in 1962. The legislation took away the
                park Service's responsibilities for recreation planning and
                assistance together with some of its staff and fund, but the Service
                later regained these functions when the Bureau, reconstituted in
                1978 as the Heritage Conservation and Recreation Service, expired in
                1981.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>National Historic Preservation Act of 1966</b> - The 1966 Act
                required that all historical parks be entered in the National
                Register of Historic Places. National Park Service and other federal
                agency measures that would affect historic sites became subject to
                review by state historic preservation officers and the Advisory
                Council on Historic Preservation, a new federal agency established
                by the Act.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>Wild and Scenic Rivers Act, 1968</b> - The Wild and Scenic Rivers
                Act provided for the protection and preservation in free-flowing
                condition of selected rivers that possessed outstanding scenic,
                recreational, geologic, fish and wildlife, historic, or cultural
                values. It identified eight rivers and adjacent lands in nine states
                as initial components of the wild and scenic rivers system, to be
                administered variously by the secretaries of Agriculture and the
                Interior. It also named 27 other rivers or river segments to be
                studied as potential additions to the wild and scenic rivers system.
                The legislation added to the National Park System long, winding
                units with complex management challenges.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>National Trails System Act, 1968</b> - The National Trails System
                Act provided for the establishment of both national recreation
                trails accessible to urban areas, to be designated by the Secretary
                of the Interior and the Secretary of Agriculture according to
                specified criteria; and national scenic trails to be established by
                Congress. It designated two national scenic trails as initial
                components of the trails system: the Appalachian Trail and the
                Pacific Crest Trail. It also ordered 14 others routes to be studied
                for possible national scenic trail designation. Along with the Wild
                and Scenic Rivers Act, this legislation expanded the diversity of
                units in the National Park System. </p><b>
            </b><p><b>Volunteers in the Parks Act of 1969 - </b>This legislation
                authorized the Secretary of the Interior to establish a "volunteers
                in the parks" program to aid in interpretation functions or other
                visitor services or activities in and related to areas administered
                by the National Park Service. The legislation provided a vehicle
                that allowed the Service to utilize volunteer help and services. The
                number of volunteers and volunteers has consistently grown and has
                proven increasingly beneficial.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>National Environmental Policy Act of 1969</b> - The National
                Environmental Policy Act formed the nation's basic charter for
                environmental protection. It directed federal agencies to carry out
                their functions in a way that avoid or minimize environmental
                degradation and required them to conduct planning with studies of
                potential environmental impact for all development projects. In
                addition, the planning process would be open for public input. The
                new environmental legislation significantly increased the complexity
                of the Service's resource management in the parks.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>General Authorities Act, 1970</b> - The General Authorities Act
                of August 18, 1970, redefined the National Park System to include
                all areas managed "for park, monument, historic, parkway,
                recreational, or other purposes" by the National Park Service. This
                marked a change from earlier legislation in which Congress legally
                defined the National Park System to exclude most areas in the
                recreational category. The legislation declared the various types of
                parks to be part of a single system. </p><b>
            </b><p><b>Endangered Species Act of 1973 </b>- The Endangered Species Act
                required federal agencies to ensure that their activities
                (authorized, funded, or executed) do not jeopardize the existence of
                any endangered or threatened species of plant or animal (including
                fish) or result in the destruction or deterioration of critical
                habitat of such species. It also provided for studies to determine
                endangered or threatened species and stipulates that it is unlawful
                for a person to possess, export, or import such species. This and
                other environmental legislation of the 1960s and 1970s served to
                bolster the role of science in park management.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>Redwood National Park Expansion Act, as amended, 1978</b> - In
                the 1970s Congress grappled with the problem of the encroachment
                upon parks by adjacent activities. The coastal Redwoods in Redwood
                National Park were being threatened by logging activities outside
                the park boundaries. In 1978, Congress expanded the park boundaries
                to encompass the remaining watershed and protect the endemic
                ecosystem. The legislation was in effect a declaration encouraging
                the protection of national parks from external threats.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>National Parks and Recreation Act, 1978</b> - The Act authorized
                the additional of 15 units to the National Park System, to include
                the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. </p><b>
            </b><p><b>Archeological Resources Protection Act, 1979</b> - The
                legislation corrected more than seven decades of inadequate
                protection for archaeological sites and objects. It superceded
                Antiquities Act as the prime legislative protection for federal
                archeological resources by defining them more completely and
                establishing appropriate penalty provisions for their destruction or
                theft.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, 1980</b> - The
                Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act added more than 47
                million acres to the National Park System. Two years earlier,
                President Jimmy Carter had proclaimed national monuments totaling
                roughly 45 million acres in Alaska, greatly expanding the National
                Park Service's land management responsibilities. The 1980
                legislation sanctioned President Carter's action and converted most
                of the national monuments in Alaska into national parks and
                preserves. This legislation more than doubled the size of the
                national park system and dramatically increased the total designated
                wilderness acreage.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, 1990</b>
                - Earlier legislation had expressly forbidden the excavation of
                Indian graves and removal of human and ceremonial remains. This act
                went further, directing museums to return Indian remains to the
                direct or at least cultural descendants for reburial. Compliance
                created some difficulties for museums including those in the
                National Park Service.</p><b>
            </b><p><b>The Vail Agenda, 1992</b> - In 1992 hundreds of experts from
                within and outside the National Park Service participated in a
                conference in to commemorate the Service's seventy-fifth
                anniversary. The addressed the current status of national park
                management and made recommendations for the future. Their report,
                known as the Vail Agenda, addressed the status and needs of the
                National Parks in the 21<sup>st</sup> Century. The document
                reiterated the concerns expressed in the <i>State of the Park
                    Report</i> (1980) and the <i>General Accounting Office Report</i>
                (1987). Among the recommendations was an urgent call for park
                management grounded in scientific research. </p><b>
            </b><p><b>National Park Omnibus Management Act of 1998</b> - The broad
                Omnibus Act provided for improved management and increased
                accountability for certain National Park Service programs. It
                directed reform of the process by which areas are considered for
                addition to the National Park System. Specifically, the legislation
                provided that no study of the potential of an area for inclusion in
                the National Park System be made without the specific authorization
                of Congress. The Omnibus Act also instituted the first legislative
                reforms of the Service's concessions management practices in a
                generation. The Service responded with new regulations and
                guidelines for concessions contracts, commercial use authorization,
                and the use of franchise fees. It allowed the Service to retain
                concessions franchise fees in the parks in which they were
                collected. </p>
