Spring storms in March and April can still produce heavy snowfall that may impact travel in the region. Summer highs are typically in the 70s-80s F and afternoon thunderstorms are common in July and August.",

Conditions are most often calm, but winds can arise, especially in spring and during storm fronts.

  "weatherInfo": "Because of the extreme elevation range in these parks, weather conditions vary widely between areas. In summer, the sequoia groves have comfortable temperatures and the foothills are hot and dry. Snow lingers on high-mountain passes well into summer. In fall, some areas close or reduce their hours. Winter brings snow to sequoia groves and rain to the foothills. Be prepared for tire chain requirements. Spring is a great time to hike in the foothills and snow begins to melt at higher elevations.",

  "weatherInfo": "Shenandoah National Park has four very distinct seasons. Spring typically brings mild temperatures, rain, and wildflowers. Summer brings lush green forests, but can be hot and very humid. Fall follows with cooler temperatures and spectacular fall foliage. Winter can bring snow and ice. The park spans roughly 100 miles, which means that weather can vary greatly depending on your location. The mountain is usually 10\u00b0F cooler than the valley below. Always check the forecast, dress in layers, and be prepared.",
